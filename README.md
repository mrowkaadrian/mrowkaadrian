## Hi there üëã
I'm Adrian, and there are days when I love to write some code. Am I a *Code Junkie* or a *Wizard*? Hell nah, just a simple programmer. Sometimes I am just glued to the screen. I currently live in **Wroc≈Çaw**, but... aren't we all **World Citizens**? üåç

I would like to think of 1st December 2023 as a new start, because I have deleted my old repositories (and oooooh boy, I should've done it way way earlier).

## What do I do?
* I work daily at SmartBear.
* I used to blog a little bit, maybe someday I'll get back to it.
* I am an owner of dozens of non-finished projects.
* I currently work on this [Discord Bot](https://github.com/mrowkaadrian/homemade-discord-bot).

## What technologies do I like to use?
Let's try some badges, shall we?
